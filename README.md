## Welcome to Topaz

We're thrilled to have you explore **Topaz Language** engineered for **clarity, power, and seamless AI integration**.

Inspired by the developer-friendly philosophy of Ruby and built with a clean, LISP-like S-expression syntax, Topaz empowers both new and seasoned developers to build robust and efficient applications for the modern world.

## Core Philosophy

Topaz is more than just a programming language; it's a forward-thinking ecosystem designed to redefine developer productivity, especially when working with **AI-driven applications, embedded systems, and robotics**.

By prioritizing a **minimalist, machine-friendly S-expression syntax** and a **strong, static type system**, Topaz ensures your code is not only concise and elegant but also robust, predictable, and highly performant.

## A Taste of Topaz

See how Topaz handles functional programming with clarity. The following code creates a list of numbers and returns a new list with each number multiplied by 10.

```lisp
;; This code uses the built-in `map` function.
;; It applies a `λ` (an anonymous function) to each element of a list.

(map
  (λ (n) (* n 10))
  (list 1 2 3 4 5)
)

;; Expected Result: (list 10 20 30 40 50)
```
